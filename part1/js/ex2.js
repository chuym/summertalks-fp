 * A collatz sequence for a number is done in the following manner:
 * It always ends with the number 1.
 * If the number is even, then divide it by 2 and calculate the next number in the 
 * sequence for that number.
 * If the number is odd, then multiplty by 3 and add one, calculate the next number in 
 * the sequence.
